# Levelup

A WIP 3DS homebrew/cia/payload updater application


### Building:

Run `make` in a Windows or Linux command prompt.
DevkitARM must be installed and in your PATH. You must also have the `3ds-sdl` and `3ds-sdl_image`
packages installed using `pacman -S <package name>` after installing DevkitARM.

### Support:

For help and questions, submit a [github issue](../../issues) or contact me on the
[Nintendo Homebrew Discord][nh] by pinging me (@Sergey#5402) in a
suitable channel (#hacking-general/#off-topic).
